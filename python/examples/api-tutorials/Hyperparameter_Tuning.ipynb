    "This notebook shows how to tune hyperparameters of the server-side optimizer, specifically the *learning rate* of *FedAdam*, using the Optuna package. Optuna supports Bayesian optimization for the selection of hyperparameter values. Tuning of other hyperparameter and/or other server-side optimizers can be done analogously. The notebook *Aggregators.ipynb* shows how to use different aggregators with the FEDn Python API.\n",

    "### Using Optuna to tune the server-side learning rate of FedAdam\n",
    "The Optuna framework expects the user to define an objective function, which is used to evaluate the model given a certain set of hyperparameter values. This notebook is based on an existing example on the [FEDn Github](https://github.com/scaleoutsystems/fedn/tree/master/examples/mnist-pytorch), where we use a simple PyTorch model on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. To evaluate the performance given different hyperparameter values, we will view the accuracy on the test set as the validation accuracy and we want to find the learning rate that maximizes this metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining the objective function\n",
    "\n",
    "For each choice of hyperparameter values, we start a new session, with a given number of rounds, using FEDn and train the global model with the current hyperparameter values. When the session has finished, we evaluate the performance attained in the session. This is where the objective function comes into play! The objective function should follows these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set a range for each hyperparameter to tune using the `trial` object in Optuna.\n",
    "2. **Train the model**, using the hyperparameters suggested by Optuna.\n",
    "3. Calculate and **return an evaluation metric**.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we define the objective function, we will create a function that defines how the evaluation metric shall be calculated (step 3) after each finished session. Below are two suggested methods for evaluating the performance attained in a session:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Highest score** - select the highest achieved test accuracy out of all rounds in the session.\n",
    "* **Average final few rounds** - compute the average test accuracy over the final few (ex. 5) rounds to account for the stochastic nature of the test accuracy score.\n",
    "\n",

    "In this post, we showed how to integrate Optuna with FEDn for hyperparameter tuning, using the example of tuning the learning rate of FedAdam. By defining an objective function and leveraging Optuna's efficient optimization, we automated the search for the best server-side learning rate to maximize test accuracy. With FEDn’s flexible API, we were able to evaluate performance in a flexible manner, whether by selecting the highest accuracy or averaging the final rounds."
