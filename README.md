FEDn is a modular and model agnostic framework for Hierarchical Federated Machine Learning. Scale seamlessly from pseudo-distributed development to real-world production networks in distributed, heterogeneous environments.

Community support: [Scaleout Discord server](https://discord.gg/KMg4VwszAd) 

## Core Features

- **ML-framework agnostic**. Model updates are treated as black-box computations. This means that it is possible to support virtually any ML model type or framework. Support for Keras and PyTorch is available out-of-the-box, and support for many other model types, including models from SKLearn, are in active development.
- **Hierarchical Federated Learning for high scalability**. FEDn allows for massive horizontal scaling. This is achieved by a hierarchical architecture where multiple combiners divide up the work to coordinate client updates and aggregation. Recent benchmarks show high performance both for thousands of clients in a cross-device setting and for large model updates (1GB) in a cross-silo setting, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00148.
- **Built for real-world production scenarios**. The implementation is based on proven design patterns in distributed computing and incorporates enterprise security features. A key feature is that clients do not have to expose any ingress ports.
- **UI to manage alliances, track training progress and follow client validations in real time**. FEDn has a UI that lets you efficiently track events, training progress, visualize model validations accross the federation, and monitor both client and server performance.

## Getting started 

The easiest way to start with FEDn is to use the provided docker-compose templates to launch a pseudo-distributed environment consisting of one Reducer, one Combiner, and a few Clients. Together with the supporting storage and database services this makes up a minimal system for developing a federated model and learning the FEDn architecture.  

Clone the repository and follow these steps:

### Pseudo-distributed deployment
We provide docker-compose templates for a minimal standalone, pseudo-distributed Docker deployment, useful for local testing and development on a single host machine. 

1. Create a default docker network  

We need to make sure that all services deployed on our single host can communicate on the same docker network. Therefore, our provided docker-compose templates use a default external network 'fedn_default'. First, create this network: 

````bash 
docker network create fedn_default
````

2. Deploy the base services (Minio and MongoDB)  

````bash 
docker-compose -f config/base-services.yaml -f config/private-network.yaml up 
````

Make sure you can access the following services before proceeding to the next steps: 
 - Minio: http://localhost:9000
 - Mongo Express: http://localhost:8081

(You can update username and password for the services in config/base-services.yaml, default values: user=fedn_admin, password=password)
 
3. Start the Reducer  

Copy the settings config file for the reducer, 'config/settings-reducer.yaml.template' to 'config/settings-reducer.yaml'. You do not need to make any changes to this file to run the sandbox. To start the reducer service:

````bash 
docker-compose -f config/reducer.yaml -f config/private-network.yaml up 
````

Make sure that you can access the Reducer UI at https://localhost:8090. 

4. Start a combiner  

Copy the settings config file for the combiner, 'config/settings-combiner.yaml.template' to 'config/settings-combiner.yaml'. You do not need to make any changes to this file to run the sandbox. To start the combiner service and attach it to the reducer:

````bash 
docker-compose -f config/combiner.yaml -f config/private-network.yaml up 
````

You should now see the combiner listed in the 'Network' view in the UI.  

### Train a federated model

Training a federated model on the FEDn network involves: 

 1. Configuring the network with a compute package (containing the code that will be distributed to clients)
 2. Setting an initial model (untrained or pre-trained)
 3. Attaching clients to the network 

Follow the instruction here to set up your deployed network to train a model for digits classification using the MNIST dataset:
