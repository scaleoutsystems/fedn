# zlib version 1:1.3.dfsg+really1.3.1-1+b1 is installed from Debian Testing (Trixie) repository,
# but Trivy assumes an older version of zlib because base image uses Debian Bookworm and
# therefore raises the vulnerability alert CVE-2023-45853.
# 
# See this discussion about a similar issue: https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/discussions/6059

# Ignoring this vulnerability since it is fixed in this PR: https://github.com/scaleoutsystems/fedn/pull/787
