What is Federated Learning? 
===========================

Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized approach that tackles the issues of centralized machine learning by allowing models to be trained on data distributed across various locations without moving the data. Instead, FL moves the computation to where the data exists, enabling the creation of strong, globally-informed models while preserving data privacy and security.

Traditional machine learning
-----------------------------

Traditionally, machine learning follows a centralized model. This approach involves collecting data from various sources into a single, centralized repository, typically in a cloud environment or a dedicated data center. Then, advanced algorithms are applied to this consolidated dataset, training predictive models that can be deployed to make decisions based on new incoming data.

However, the centralized machine learning paradigm is facing growing challenges. The explosion of connected devices, sensors, and distributed data sources has led to an exponential increase in the volume and complexity of data being generated. At the same time, concerns around privacy, security, and regulatory compliance have made it increasingly difficult to freely move and consolidate data from different sources.

The data needed to train effective machine learning models is often distributed across organizations, devices, or clients, making centralization challenging due to privacy risks and high transfer costs.

How federated learning works
-----------------------------

In federated learning, AI models are trained across multiple devices or servers (called client nodes) without needing to move the data off those devices. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how it works:

1. **Starting the global model -** The process begins with a global model on a central server. This could be any type of machine learning model, like a neural network or decision tree.
2. **Sending the model to clients -** The server sends the global model’s parameters to a group of selected client nodes. Each client uses its own local dataset, which stays securely on the device.
3. **Local training -** Each client trains the model using its local data, adjusting the model’s parameters based on what it learns from the data. This training process is repeated for several rounds, rather than continuing until full accuracy is achieved.
4. **Combining the updates -** The updated models from each client are sent back to the central server, where they are combined. A common approach is called Federated Averaging, where the server takes a weighted average of the updates from each client.

At last, the improved global model is sent back to the clients for further training. This cycle continues until the model reaches a satisfactory level of accuracy.

The FEDn framework 
--------------------

The goal with FEDn is to provide a federated learning framework that is secure, scalable and easy-to-use. Our ambition is that FEDn supports the full journey from early
testing/exploration, through pilot projects, to real-world depoyments and integration. We believe that that minimal code change should be needed to progress from early proof-of-concepts to production. This is reflected in our core design: 

-  **Minimal server-side complexity for the end-user**. Running a proper distributed FL deployment is hard. With FEDn Studio we seek to handle all server-side complexity and provide a UI, REST API and a Python interface to help users manage FL experiments and track metrics in real time.

-  **Secure by design.** FL clients do not need to open any ingress ports. Industry-standard communication protocols (gRPC) and token-based authentication and RBAC (Jason Web Tokens) provides flexible integration in a range of production environments.  

-  **ML-framework agnostic**. A black-box client-side architecture lets data scientists interface with their framework of choice. 

-  **Cloud native.** By following cloud native design principles, we ensure a wide range of deployment options including private cloud and on-premise infrastructure. 

-  **Scalability and resilience.** Multiple aggregation servers (combiners) can share the workload. FEDn seamlessly recover from failures in all critical components and manages intermittent client-connections. 

-  **Developer and DevOps friendly.** Extensive event logging and distributed tracing enables developers to monitor the sytem in real-time, simplifying troubleshooting and auditing. Extensions and integrations are facilitated by a flexible plug-in architecture.
