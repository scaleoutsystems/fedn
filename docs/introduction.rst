What is Federated Learning? 
===========================

Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning approach. Instead of collecting data in one place, FL sends the model to where the data is—training happens locally on distributed devices or systems. The results are then aggregated into a single global model, all while keeping raw data private and secure.

Traditional machine learning
-----------------------------

Traditional machine learning is centralized. Data from various sources is collected into a single location - typically a cloud platform or data center — and training models on that combined dataset.

This method works well in many cases, but it’s increasingly limited. The rapid growth of connected devices, sensors and distributed data sources has led to an exponential increase in data volume and complexity. Meanwhile, privacy regulations and security concerns make centralizing this data difficult and expensive.

Often, the data needed for training exists across many devices, organizations, or locations. Centralizing it is challenging due to privacy risks and high transfer costs.

How federated learning works
-----------------------------

In federated learning, models are trained across multiple devices or servers (called client nodes) without moving the data. Here's how it works:

1. **Initialize the global model -** A central server starts with an initial global model—like a neural network or decision tree.
2. **Sending to clients -** The model's parameters are sent to selected clients. Each client keeps its local dataset private.
3. **Local training -** Each client updates the model using its local data. This training is repeated in several rounds — not to completion.
4. **Combining the updates -** The updated models from each client are sent back to the central server, where they are combined. 

This cycle repeats until the global model reaches the desired accuracy.

The FEDn framework 
--------------------

FEDn is a federated learning framework focused on security, scalability, and ease of use. It supports the full development lifecycle—from early experiments to production deployments—with minimal code changes. Key design goals include:

-  **Minimal server-side complexity for the end-user**. FEDn Studio handles orchestration, providing a UI, REST API, and Python interface for managing experiments and tracking metrics in real time.

-  **Secure by design.** Clients never need to open inbound ports. gRPC, token-based authentication (JWT) and RBAC provides flexible and secure integration. 

-  **ML-framework agnostic**. A black-box client-side architecture lets data scientists use any ML framework. 

-  **Cloud native.** Deploy on public cloud, private cloud, or on-prem infrastructure.

-  **Scalability and resilience.** Multiple combiners can balance load. FEDn handles failures in all critical components and manages intermittent client-connections. 

-  **Developer and DevOps friendly.** Logging, tracing, and plugin architecture simplify monitoring, debugging, and extending the system.  

Features
--------

Federated learning: 

- Tiered federated learning architecture enabling massive scalability and resilience. 
- Support for any ML framework (examples for PyTorch, Tensforflow/Keras and Scikit-learn)
- Extendable via a plug-in architecture (aggregators, load balancers, object storage backends, databases  etc.)
- Built-in federated algorithms (FedAvg, FedAdam, FedYogi, FedAdaGrad, etc.)
- UI, CLI and Python API.
