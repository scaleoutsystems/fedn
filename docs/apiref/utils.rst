Scaleout Edge API Client
========================

This section documents the **Scaleout Edge API Client**, the high-level
interface used by external applications, orchestration layers, and tools to
interact with a running Scaleout Edge network. The API Client provides
convenient methods for:

- querying network state
- managing clients, attributes, and sessions
- submitting models and retrieving results
- interacting with controllers, combiners, and server functions

It acts as the primary Python entry point for programmatic communication with
the Scaleout Edge backend.
