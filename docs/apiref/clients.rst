Scaleout Edge Clients
=====================

This section documents the client implementations available for Scaleout Edge.
Clients run on edge devices and communicate with the Scaleout Edge network to
perform local training, evaluation, and model exchange. Multiple client
implementations exist to support different environments and programming
languages.

Python Client
-------------

The Python client provides a high-level API for integrating local training code
with the Scaleout Edge network. It is suitable for servers, development
machines, notebooks, and lightweight edge devices.

Additional Clients
------------------

Support for additional client implementations (e.g., C++ and Kotlin) will be
included here in future versions of the documentation.
