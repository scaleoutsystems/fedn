Quickstart Tutorial PyTorch (MNIST)
===================================

.. note::
   This tutorial is a quickstart guide to FEDn where the federated learning project has been defined
   using an already implemented ``compute package``. This turorial is a good starting point for developers, however,
   head over to :ref:`tutorial-label` when you are ready to define your own federated learning projects.

This classic example of hand-written text recognition is well suited as a lightweight test when developing on FEDn in pseudo-distributed mode. 
A normal high-end laptop or a workstation should be able to sustain a few clients. 
The example automates the partitioning of data and deployment of a variable number of clients on a single host. 
We here assume working experience with containers, Docker and docker-compose. 
   
Prerequisites
-------------

-  `Python 3.8, 3.9 or 3.10 <https://www.python.org/downloads>`__
-  `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker>`__
-  `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install>`__

Launch a pseudo-distributed FEDn Network 
-------------


Clone this repository, locate into it and start a pseudo-distributed FEDn network using docker-compose:

.. code-block::

   docker-compose up 

This starts up the needed backend services MongoDB and Minio, the API Server and one Combiner. 
You can verify the deployment using these urls: 

- API Server: http://localhost:8092/get_controller_status
- Minio: http://localhost:9000
- Mongo Express: http://localhost:8081

.. warning:: 
   The FEDn network is configured to use a local Minio and MongoDB instances for storage. This is not suitable for production, but is fine for testing.

Install the FEDn SDK
-------------

.. note::
    To programmatically interact with the FEDn network use the APIClient.
    Install the FEDn via pip:

    .. code-block:: bash
       
       $ pip install fedn
       # or from source
       $ cd fedn/fedn
       $ pip install . 


Prepare the compute package and seed the FEDn network
-------------

Next, we will prepare the client. A key concept in FEDn is the compute package - 
a code bundle that contains entrypoints for training and (optionally) validating a model update on the client. 

Locate into ``examples/mnist-pytorch`` and familiarize yourself with the project structure. The entrypoints
are defined in 'client/entrypoint'. The dependencies needed in the client environment are specified in 
``requirements.txt``. For convenience, we have provided utility scripts to set up a virtual environment.   

Start by initializing a virtual enviroment with all of the required dependencies for this project.

.. code-block:: python

   bin/init_venv.sh

Now create the compute package and an initial model:

.. code-block::

   bin/build.sh


Upload the compute package and seed model to FEDn:

.. code:: python

   >>> from fedn import APIClient
   >>> client = APIClient(host="localhost", port=8092)
   >>> client.set_package("package.tgz", helper="numpyhelper")
   >>> client.set_initial_model("seed.npz")

Configure and attach clients
-------------

The next step is to configure and attach clients. For this we need to download data and make data partitions: 

Download the data:

.. code-block::

   bin/get_data


Split the data in 2 parts for the clients:

.. code-block::

   bin/split_data

Data partitions will be generated in the folder 'data/clients'.  


FEDn relies on a configuration file for the client to connect to the server. Create a file called 'client.yaml' with the follwing content:

.. code-block::

   network_id: fedn-network
   discover_host: api-server
   discover_port: 8092

(optional) Use the APIClient to fetch the client configuration and save it to a file:

.. code:: python

   >>> import yaml
   >>> config = client.get_client_config(checksum=True)
   >>> with open("client.yaml", "w") as f:
   >>>    f.write(yaml.dump(config))

Make sure to move the file ``client.yaml`` to the root of the examples/mnist-pytorch folder.
To connect a client that uses the data partition ``data/clients/1/mnist.pt`` and the config file ``client.yaml`` to the network, run the following docker command:

.. code-block::

   docker run \
  -v $PWD/client.yaml:/app/client.yaml \
  -v $PWD/data/clients/1:/var/data \
  -e ENTRYPOINT_OPTS=--data_path=/var/data/mnist.pt \
  --network=fedn_default \
  ghcr.io/scaleoutsystems/fedn/fedn:0.8.0-mnist-pytorch run client -in client.yaml --name client1 


Start a training session
-------------

Observe the API Server logs and combiner logs, you should see the client connecting.
You are now ready to start training the model. In the python enviroment you installed FEDn:

.. code:: python

   >>> ...
   >>> client.start_session(session_id="test-session", rounds=3)
   # Wait for training to complete, when controller is idle:
   >>> client.get_controller_status()
   # Show model trail:
   >>> client.get_model_trail()
   # Show model performance:
   >>> client.list_validations()

Please see :py:mod:`fedn.network.api` for more details on the APIClient. 

There is also a Jupyter `Notebook <https://github.com/scaleoutsystems/fedn/blob/master/examples/mnist-pytorch/API_Example.ipynb>`_ version of this tutorial including examples of how to fetch and visualize model validations.

Automate experimentation with several clients  
----------------------------------------------------------
You can use the provided docker-compose templates to automate deployment of FEDn and clients. 

Split the dataset in 4 partitions:

.. code-block::

   bin/split_data --num_splits=4 


To start 4 clients, standing in ``examples/mnist-pytorch``, run the following docker compose command: 

.. code-block::

   docker-compose -f ../../docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.override.yaml up --scale client=4 


Access logs and validation data from MongoDB  
--------------------------------------------
You can access and download event logs and validation data via the API, and you can also as a developer obtain 
the MongoDB backend data using pymongo or via the MongoExpress interface: 

- http://localhost:8081/db/fedn-network/ 

The credentials are as set in docker-compose.yaml in the root of the repository. 

Access model updates  
--------------------

You can obtain model updates from the 'fedn-models' bucket in Minio: 

- http://localhost:9000


Clean up
--------
You can clean up by running 

.. code-block::

   docker-compose down

Where to go from here? 
--------
With you first FEDn federation deployed, we suggest that you take a close look at how a FEDn project is structured
and how you develop your own compute package:

- Compute package: :ref:`tutorial-label`
