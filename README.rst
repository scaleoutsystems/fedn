FEDn is a modular and model agnostic framework for
federated machine learning. FEDn is designed to scale from pseudo-distributed
development on your laptop to real-world production setups in geographically distributed environments. 

Core Features
=============

-  **Scalable and resilient.** FEDn is scalable and resilient via a tiered 
   architecture where multiple aggregation servers (combiners) divide up the work to coordinate clients and aggregate models. 
   Benchmarks show high performance both for thousands of clients in a cross-device
   setting and for large model updates in a cross-silo setting. 
   FEDn has the ability to recover from failure in all critical components. 

-  **Security**. FEDn is built using secure industry standard communication protocols (gRPC). A key feature is that
   clients do not have to expose any ingress ports. 

-  **Track events and training progress in real-time**. FEDn tracks events for clients and aggregation servers, logging to MongoDB. This
   helps developers monitor traning progress in real-time, and to troubleshoot the distributed computation.  
   Tracking and model validation data can easily be retrieved using the API enabling development of custom dashboards and visualizations. 

-  **Flexible handling of asynchronous clients**. FEDn supports flexible experimentation 
   with clients coming in and dropping out during training sessions. Extend aggregators to experiment 
   with different strategies to handle so called stragglers.

-  **ML-framework agnostic**. Model updates are treated as black-box
   computations. This means that it is possible to support any
   ML model type or framework. Support for Keras and PyTorch is
   available out-of-the-box.


Getting started
===============

The best way to get started is to take the quickstart tutorial: 

- `Quickstart PyTorch <https://fedn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html>`__

Documentation
=============
You will find more details about the architecture, compute package and how to deploy FEDn fully distributed in the documentation:

-  `Documentation <https://fedn.readthedocs.io>`__
-  `Paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00148>`__


FEDn Studio
===============
Scaleout also develops FEDn Studio, a web application that extends the FEDn SDK with a UI, production-grade deployment of the FEDn server side on Kubernetes, user authentication/authorization, client identity/API-token management, and project-based multitenancy for segmenting work and resources into collaboration workspaces. FEDn Studio is available as a fully managed service.  
There is also additional tooling and charts for self-managed deployment on Kubernetes including integration with several projects from the cloud native landscape. 
See  `FEDn Framework <https://www.scaleoutsystems.com/framework>`__  for more information.
