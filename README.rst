FEDn: An enterprise-ready federated learning framework 
-------------------------------------------------------

Our goal is to provide a federated learning framework that is both secure, scalable and easy-to-use. We believe that that minimal code change should be needed to progress from early proof-of-concepts to production. This is reflected in our core design: 

-  **Minimal server-side complexity for the end-user**. Running a proper distributed FL deployment is hard. With FEDn Studio we seek to handle all server-side complexity and provide a UI, REST API and a Python interface to help users manage FL experiments and track metrics in real time.

-  **Secure by design.** FL clients do not need to open any ingress ports. Industry-standard communication protocols (gRPC) and token-based authentication and RBAC (Jason Web Tokens) provides flexible integration in a range of production environments.  

-  **ML-framework agnostic**. A black-box client-side architecture lets data scientists interface with their framework of choice. 

-  **Cloud native.** By following cloud native design principles, we ensure a wide range of deployment options including private cloud and on-premise infrastructure. 

-  **Scalability and resilience.** Multiple aggregation servers (combiners) can share the workload. FEDn seamlessly recover from failures in all critical components and manages intermittent client-connections. 

-  **Developer and DevOps friendly.** Extensive event logging and distributed tracing enables developers to monitor the sytem in real-time, simplifying troubleshooting and auditing. Extensions and integrations are facilitated by a flexible plug-in architecture.  

We provide a fully managed deployment for testing, academic, and personal use. Sign up for a `FEDn Studio account <https://fedn.scaleoutsystems.com/signup>`__  and take the `Quickstart tutorial <https://fedn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html>`__ to get started with FEDn. 

Features
=========

Federated learning: 

- Tiered federated learning architecture enabling massive scalability and resilience. 
- Support for any ML framework (examples for PyTorch, Tensforflow/Keras and Scikit-learn)
- Extendable via a plug-in architecture (aggregators, load balancers, object storage backends, databases  etc.)
- Built-in federated algorithms (FedAvg, FedAdam, FedYogi, FedAdaGrad, etc.)
- UI, CLI and Python API.
- Implement clients in any language (Python, C++, Kotlin etc.)
- No open ports needed client-side.


From development to FL in production: 

-  Secure deployment of server-side / control-plane on Kubernetes.
-  UI with dashboards for orchestrating FL experiments and for visualizing results
-  Team features - collaborate with other users in shared project workspaces. 
-  Features for the trusted-third party: Manage access to the FL network, FL clients and training progress.
-  REST API for handling experiments/jobs. 
-  View and export logging and tracing information. 
-  Public cloud, dedicated cloud and on-premise deployment options.

Available client APIs:

- Python client (this repository)
- C++ client (`FEDn C++ client <https://github.com/scaleoutsystems/fedn-cpp-client>`__)
- Android Kotlin client (`FEDn Kotlin client <https://github.com/scaleoutsystems/fedn-android-client>`__)


Getting started
============================

Get started with FEDn in two steps:  

1. Register for a `FEDn Studio account <https://fedn.scaleoutsystems.com/signup>`__
2. Take the `Quickstart tutorial <https://fedn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html>`__

Use of our multi-tenant, managed deployment of FEDn Studio (SaaS) is free forever for academic research and personal development/testing purposes.
For users and teams requiring additional resources, more storage and cpu, dedicated support, and other hosting options (private cloud, on-premise), `explore our plans <https://www.scaleoutsystems.com/start#pricing>`__.
