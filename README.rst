FEDn is a modular and model agnostic framework for hierarchical
federated machine learning which scales from pseudo-distributed
development to real-world production networks in distributed,
heterogeneous environments. For more details see https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00148.

Core Features
=============

-  **Scalable and resilient.** FEDn is highly scalable and resilient via a tiered 
   architecture where multiple aggregation servers (combiners) form a network to divide up the work to coordinate clients and aggregate models. 
   Recent benchmarks show high performance both for thousands of clients in a cross-device
   setting and for large model updates (1GB) in a cross-silo setting. 
   FEDn has the ability to recover from failure in all critical components.  
   
-  **ML-framework agnostic**. Model updates are treated as black-box
   computations. This means that it is possible to support any
   ML model type or framework. Support for Keras and PyTorch is
   available out-of-the-box.

-  **Security**. A key feature is that
   clients do not have to expose any ingress ports.
 
-  **Track events and training progress**. FEDn logs events in the federation and tracks both training and validation progress in real time. Data is    logged as JSON to MongoDB and a user can easily make custom dashboards and visualizations. 

- **UI.** A Flask UI lets user visualize the FEDn network and model validations in real time, as well as see other core metrics like client training times and combiner load.  

Getting started
===============

Prerequisites
-------------

-  `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker>`__
-  `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install>`__
-  `Python 3.8 <https://www.python.org/downloads>`__

Quick start
-----------

The quickest way to get started with FEDn is by trying out the `MNIST
Keras example <https://github.com/scaleoutsystems/fedn/tree/master/examples/mnist-keras>`__. Alternatively, you can start the
base services along with combiner and reducer as it follows.

.. code-block::

   docker-compose up -d

Distributed deployment
======================

We provide instructions for a distributed reference deployment here:
