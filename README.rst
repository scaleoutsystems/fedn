FEDn
--------

FEDn empowers its users to create federated learning applications that seamlessly transition from local proofs-of-concept to secure distributed deployments. 

Leverage a flexible pseudo-local sandbox to rapidly transition your existing ML project to a federated setting. Test and scale in real-world scenarios using FEDn Studio - a fully managed, secure deployment of all server-side components (SaaS). 

We develop the FEDn framework following these core design principles:

-  **Seamless transition from proof-of-concepts to real-world FL**. FEDn has been designed to make the journey from R&D to real-world deployments as smooth as possibe. Develop your federated learning use case in a pseudo-local environment, then deploy it to FEDn Studio (cloud or on-premise) for real-world scenarios. No code change is required to go from development and testing to production. 

-  **Designed for scalability and resilience.** FEDn enables model aggregation through multiple aggregation servers sharing the workload. A hierarchical architecture makes the framework well suited borh for cross-silo and cross-device use-cases. FEDn seamlessly recover from failures in all critical components, and manages intermittent client-connections, ensuring robust deployment in production environments.

-  **Secure by design.** FL clients do not need to open any ingress ports, facilitating distributed deployments across a wide variety of settings. Additionally, FEDn utilizes secure, industry-standard communication protocols and supports token-based authentication and RBAC for FL clients (JWT), providing flexible integration in production environments.   

-  **Developer and data scientist friendly.** Extensive event logging and distributed tracing enables developers to monitor experiments in real-time, simplifying troubleshooting and auditing. Machine learning metrics can be accessed via both a Python API and visualized in an intuitive UI that helps the data scientists analyze and communicate ML-model training progress.


Features
=========

Federated machine learning: 

- Support for any ML framework (e.g. PyTorch, Tensforflow/Keras and Scikit-learn)
- Extendable via a plug-in architecture (aggregators, load balancers, object storage backends, databases  etc.)
- Built-in federated algorithms (FedAvg, FedAdam, FedYogi, FedAdaGrad, etc.)
- CLI and Python API client for running FEDn networks and coordinating experiments. 
- Implement clients in any language (Python, C++, Kotlin etc.)
- No open ports needed client-side.


FEDn Studio - From development to FL in production: 

-  Leverage Scaleout's free managed service for development and testing in real-world scenarios (SaaS).      
-  Token-based authentication (JWT) and role-based access control (RBAC) for FL clients.  
-  REST API and UI. 
-  Data science dashboard for orchestrating experiments and visualizing results.
-  Admin dashboard for managing the FEDn network and users/clients.
-  View extensive logging and tracing information. 
-  Collaborate with other data-scientists on the project specification in a shared workspace. 
-  Cloud or on-premise deployment (cloud-native design, deploy to any Kubernetes cluster)


Getting started
============================

The best way to get started is to take the quickstart tutorial: 

- `Quickstart <https://fedn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html>`__

Documentation
=============

More details about the architecture, deployment, and how to develop your own application and framework extensions (such as custom aggregators) are found in the documentation:

-  `Documentation <https://fedn.readthedocs.io>`__


Running your project in FEDn Studio (SaaS or on-premise)
========================================================

The FEDn Studio SaaS is free for development, testing and research (one project per user, backend compute resources sized for dev/test):   

- `Register for a free account in FEDn Studio <https://fedn.scaleoutsystems.com/signup/>`__
- `Take the tutorial to deploy your project on FEDn Studio <https://fedn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/studio.html>`__  

Scaleout can also support users to scale up experiments and demonstrators on Studio, by granting custom resource quotas. Additonally, charts are available for self-managed deployment on-premise or in your cloud VPC (all major cloud providers). Contact the Scaleout team for more information.
