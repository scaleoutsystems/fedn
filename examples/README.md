## Examples

This folder contains examples of [FEDn Projects](https://fedn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projects.html).

We recommend all new users to start with the [Quickstart Tutorial](https://fedn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html).

Additionally, we include a curated list of examples provided both by the Scaleout core team and external users. These examples may or may not have been tested with the latest FEDn release. Please refer to the documentation of each specific project/example for details. 

If you have a project that you want to include in this list, reach out to a core developer in [Discord](https://discord.gg/CCRgjpMsVA) or send a pull-request with an update to this file.
