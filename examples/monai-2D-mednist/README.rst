FEDn Project: MonAI 2D Classification with the MedNIST Dataset (PyTorch)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an example FEDn Project based on the  MonAI 2D Classification with the MedNIST Dataset. 
The example is intented as a minimalistic quickstart and automates the handling of training data
by letting the client download and create its partition of the dataset as it starts up.

Prerequisites
-------------

Using FEDn Studio:

-  `Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 or 3.11 <https://www.python.org/downloads>`__
-  `A FEDn Studio account <https://fedn.scaleoutsystems.com/signup>`__   

If using pseudo-distributed mode with docker-compose:

-  `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker>`__
-  `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install>`__

Creating the compute package and seed model
-------------------------------------------

Install fedn: 

.. code-block::

   pip install fedn

Clone this repository, then locate into this directory:

.. code-block::

   git clone https://github.com/scaleoutsystems/fedn.git
   cd fedn/examples/monai-2D-mednist

Create the compute package:

.. code-block::

   fedn package create --path client

This should create a file 'package.tgz' in the project folder.

Next, generate a seed model (the first model in a global model trail):

.. code-block::

   fedn run build --path client

This will create a seed model called 'seed.npz' in the root of the project. This step will take a few minutes, depending on hardware and internet connection (builds a virtualenv).  

Using FEDn Studio
-----------------

Follow the guide here to set up your FEDn Studio project and learn how to connect clients (using token authentication): `Studio guide <https://fedn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/studio.html>`__.
On the step "Upload Files", upload 'package.tgz' and 'seed.npz' created above. 

Connecting clients:
===================

**NOTE: In case a different data path needs to be set, use the env variable FEDN_DATA_PATH.**

.. code-block::

   export FEDN_PACKAGE_EXTRACT_DIR=package
   export FEDN_DATA_PATH=./data/
   export FEDN_CLIENT_SETTINGS_PATH=<full_path_to_the_dir>/client_settings.yaml
   fedn client start -in client.yaml --secure=True --force-ssl

Connecting clients using Docker:
================================

For convenience, there is a Docker image hosted on ghrc.io with fedn preinstalled. To start a client using Docker: 

.. code-block::

   docker run \
     -v $PWD/client.yaml:/app/client.yaml \
     -v $PWD/client_settings.yaml:/app/client_settings.yaml \
     -e FEDN_PACKAGE_EXTRACT_DIR=package \
     -e FEDN_DATA_PATH=./data/ \
     -e FEDN_CLIENT_SETTINGS_PATH=/app/client_settings.yaml \
     ghcr.io/scaleoutsystems/fedn/fedn:0.9.0 run client -in client.yaml --force-ssl --secure=True


**NOTE: The following instructions are only for SDK-based client communication and for local development environments using Docker.**


Local development mode using Docker/docker compose
--------------------------------------------------

Follow the steps above to install FEDn, generate 'package.tgz' and 'seed.tgz'.

Start a pseudo-distributed FEDn network using docker-compose:

.. code-block::

   docker compose \
    -f ../../docker-compose.yaml \
    -f docker-compose.override.yaml \
    up

This starts up local services for MongoDB, Minio, the API Server, one Combiner and two clients. 
You can verify the deployment using these urls: 

- API Server: http://localhost:8092/get_controller_status
- Minio: http://localhost:9000
- Mongo Express: http://localhost:8081

Upload the package and seed model to FEDn controller using the APIClient. In Python:

.. code-block::

   from fedn import APIClient
   client = APIClient(host="localhost", port=8092)
   client.set_active_package("package.tgz", helper="numpyhelper")
   client.set_active_model("seed.npz")

You can now start a training session with 5 rounds (default): 

.. code-block::

   client.start_session()

Automate experimentation with several clients  
=============================================

If you want to scale the number of clients, you can do so by modifying ``docker-compose.override.yaml``. For example, 
in order to run with 3 clients, change the environment variable ``FEDN_NUM_DATA_SPLITS`` to 3, and add one more client 
by copying ``client1`` and setting ``FEDN_DATA_PATH`` to ``/app/package/data3/``


Access message logs and validation data from MongoDB  
====================================================

You can access and download event logs and validation data via the API, and you can also as a developer obtain 
the MongoDB backend data using pymongo or via the MongoExpress interface: 

- http://localhost:8081/db/fedn-network/ 

The credentials are as set in docker-compose.yaml in the root of the repository. 

Access global models   
====================

You can obtain global model updates from the 'fedn-models' bucket in Minio: 

- http://localhost:9000

Reset the FEDn deployment   
=========================

To purge all data from a deployment incuding all session and round data, access the MongoExpress UI interface and 
delete the entire ``fedn-network`` collection. Then restart all services. 

Clean up
========
You can clean up by running 

.. code-block::

   docker-compose -f ../../docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.override.yaml down -v
