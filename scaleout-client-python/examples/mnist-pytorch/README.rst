Scaleout Edge Project: MNIST (PyTorch)
-----------------------------

This is a minimal Scaleout Edge project based on the classic hand-written digit recognition dataset MNIST,
implemented in PyTorch. The example is intended as a simple quickstart to learn how to use Scaleout Edge.

**Note:** We recommend that all new users start by taking the Quickstart Tutorial:
https://scaleout.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html


Prerequisites
-------------

-  `Python >=3.9, <=3.12 <https://www.python.org/downloads>`__


Creating the compute package and seed model
------------------------------------------

Install scaleout:

Clone the Scaleout repository and locate into this example directory:

We recommend installing in a virtual environment.

.. code-block::

   git clone https://github.com/scaleoutsystems/scaleout.git
   cd scaleout/scaleout-client-python/examples/mnist-pytorch
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install scaleout


Create the compute package:

.. code-block::

   scaleout package create --path client

This creates a file ``package.tgz`` in the project folder.


Next, generate a seed model (the first model in a global model trail).  
Install dependencies and build the client:

.. code-block::

   scaleout run install --path client
   scaleout run build --path client

This will create a model file ``seed.npz`` in the root of the project.  
This step will take a few minutes, depending on hardware and internet connection (builds a virtualenv).
